My own chip-8 emulator written in C  
Right now to build the project use the makefile:  

```cmd
make
```
To delete the project and the obj files:  

```cmd
make clean 
```
To rebuild the project:  

```cmd
make remake 
```
and then to run the emulator:  

```cmd
./Cemul8 PathToROM.ch8 or ./Cemul8 PathToROM.c8
```
